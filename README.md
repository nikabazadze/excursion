# Excursion Project
This is the Excursion project from the Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineering course

## Overview
In this project, I have created a web page which advertises a product called “Excursion”. I used HTML5, CSS3, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub to complete this project.

The web page advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, so I have used video and landscape imagery (provided by Codecademy) to set the scene.
